1) Instanced Based Learning VS Model Based Learning

    a - An instanced based learning will memorize all data from training and use all data trained to predict the output. 
        whereas a Model Based Learning create a model from data and use it to predict the output.

    b - For KNN we use all data from training to predict the output of data tested so it's an Instanced Based Learning.

    c - As we saw, with KNN, we can predict a category (label for ex3) or a numerical value (mean for ex5)
        So we can use them both depending what problem we want to solve.

    d - Larger K values are beneficial when the accurary increases thanks to more neighbors

    e - Larger K values are detrimental when the accurary decreases because of too much neighbors. For example, when K is equal to the number of training 
        points, prediction function is constant.
    
    f - When two classes have the same number of votes, we have to choose a tie-break.

    g - When we have a classification problem with a lot of classes, it's need a lot of training datas. As the KNN is 
        instanced based learning with O(N) complexity, prediction will take too much time.
