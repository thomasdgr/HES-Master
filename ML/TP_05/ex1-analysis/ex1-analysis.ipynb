    "The bank UBS is offering to its client the possibility to invest money in funds. See https://fundgate.ubs.com/. There are thousands of investment funds available. Clients, according to their profile, will be more or less inclined to invest in a given fund, according to the fund characteristics. For example, a younger client with no child is potentially more interested into funds composed with stocks, showing higher risks but also higher potential returns. A family father will be more inclined to invest into low-risk funds. UBS want to build a system taking as input a set of values characterizing the fund and a set of values defining the client profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "An investment fund can be characterized by the following elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the fund.\n",
    "- The current value of 1 share in the fund, expressed in CHF.\n",
    "- The proportion of stock and bonds composing the fund (2 values in percentage).\n",
    "- A vector of float values with the 5 last yearly returns over years from 2015 to 2019 (5 values expressed in percentage).\n",
    "- A level of risk expressed with A, B, C, D, E with A representing the highest risk and E representing the lowest risk level.\n",
    "- A sectorial information such as technology, pharmaceutical, financial. There are 24 different sectors available in UBS funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A client profile contains the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "- First name and last name of the client.\n",
    "- The mother tongue of the client (mostly de, fr, it and en but other languages are present).\n",
    "- The age of the client.\n",
    "- The number of children of the client.\n",
    "- The current wealth of the client that could be used to buy funds, expressed in CHF (total of cash available in the different accounts, not yet invested in funds).\n",
    "- The postal code of the address of the client.\n",
    "- A level of acceptance to risk expressed with A, B, C, D, E with A representing the highest level of acceptance of risk and E representing the lowest acceptance of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each available information in the fund and client profile, explain how you would prepare the data: encoding, normalization, outlier treatment, etc.\n",
    "2. How could you collect targets (output of the system) to train the system? How would you prepare the different sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be as comprehensive as possible.** Imagine that you give your analysis to your trainee: he must be able to implement the system from it."
