# Docs directory
This directory contains the questions (peer week), which will dynamically be added.

Also in this directory you can put all kind of documentation that should be read by the professor at the end of the lab. And of course you put your answers to this directory.

Please use the following formats:

* put your answers directly into the markdown files (.md) in this directory (this can include of course any kind of code, graphics, etc.)
* PDF files
